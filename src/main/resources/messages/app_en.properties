app.fulldesc=There are robots in the game world. Robots get tasks from the queue and perform these tasks. Jobs are sent for all robots or persanally. REST API interface is implemented. Sometimes a job can mean - kill yourself, then the robot ceases to exist. There is tracker of robots' activity, if it notices that someone is lacking (commited suicide), or all robots are busy - it creates a new robot with required type. All activity of the gaming world is updated automatically on the Web UI. Also, the user can enter a job to the queue on the Web UI page - specific robot or all robots.
